# Find This Film

This Python script is designed to fetch details of a movie using the [The Movie Database (TMDB) API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api). It leverages the [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) library for creating a user-friendly web interface to display the retrieved movie details.
